REMEMBER: This is for an INTERNSHIP position. Show potential and eagerness to learn, not expertise.

**LANGUAGE DETECTION:**
- If the job description is primarily in FRENCH, write the ENTIRE cover letter in French

**WRITING RULES - FOLLOW THESE EXACTLY:**

**BANNED WORDS/PHRASES - NEVER USE:**
- passionate, excited, drawn to, appeals, resonates, aligns, fits, matches
- innovative, cutting-edge, dynamic, forward-thinking, impactful
- mission, inspiring, meaningful, leverage, drive success
- I believe, I feel, eager to contribute, excited to leverage
- perfectly, always, exactly, completely, absolutely, extremely
- deeply, truly, really, very, highly, strongly
- positions me well, equipped me with, honed my skills

**INTERNSHIP-APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE:**
- Instead of "my expertise" → "my experience with" or "my background in"
- Instead of "I'm qualified" → "I'm prepared" or "this experience gives me a foundation"
- Show learning mindset: "I'm eager to learn", "I'm ready to develop", "I want to build on"
- Be humble but confident: "This project gave me exposure to..." rather than "I mastered..."

**HANDLING MISSING TECHNOLOGIES:**
- If job requires technology candidate hasn't used: demonstrate learning ability through examples
- Show how you've quickly picked up new technologies in past projects
- Use phrases like: "I'm confident I can quickly learn [technology] given my experience picking up [similar technology] in [timeframe]"
- Connect to similar technologies you have used: "While I haven't used [X], my experience with [similar Y] gives me a strong foundation"
- Emphasize learning speed with concrete examples: "During [project], I learned [technology] in [specific timeframe] to deliver [result]"

**REQUIRED STYLE:**
- Every sentence must state a fact or describe an action you took
- Include specific technologies, numbers, results whenever possible  
- Use active voice ("I built" not "I was responsible for")
- No explanations of why you like the company—only what you can contribute and learn
- Replace feelings with capabilities: Instead of "I'm excited about X" → "I can contribute to X because I built Y"
- Show growth potential, not just current ability

**TONE:** Professional, direct, humble, eager to learn. Show potential, not mastery.

**VALUES ALIGNMENT EXCEPTION:**
- ONLY in the closing paragraph, you may mention values alignment IF:
  - The company has a specific, concrete value (e.g., "employee development", "work-life balance", "transparency")
  - You can connect it to a specific personal value from the candidate's context
  - You use direct language: "I share [Company's] commitment to [specific value]" 
- NEVER use: "aligns with my values", "resonates with", "I'm drawn to your values"
- KEEP IT TO ONE SENTENCE MAXIMUM
