## Job Description

About the job
As a global leader in cybersecurity, CrowdStrike protects the people, processes and technologies that drive modern organizations. Since 2011, our mission hasn’t changed — we’re here to stop breaches, and we’ve redefined modern security with the world’s most advanced AI-native platform. Our customers span all industries, and they count on CrowdStrike to keep their businesses running, their communities safe and their lives moving forward. We’re also a mission-driven company. We cultivate a culture that gives every CrowdStriker both the flexibility and autonomy to own their careers. We’re always looking to add talented CrowdStrikers to the team who have limitless passion, a relentless focus on innovation and a fanatical commitment to our customers, our community and each other. Our University Recruiting program is dedicated to attracting and cultivating the future leaders of this industry. This program offers paid positions for students and recent grads, designed to provide exposure to work that makes an impact while being supported through a structured experience with seasoned professionals. Ready to join a mission that matters? The future of cybersecurity starts with you.



As a Frontend Engineer Intern at CrowdStrike, you will work with a talented and dedicated team to build and maintain the user interface for the Falcon platform. You will provide a high-quality user experience that our customers around the world use 24/7 to protect their systems from the most sophisticated adversaries.

Our JavaScript framework is Ember, but if you've used React, Angular, or Vue.js, you'll feel right at home, and we’ll help you get comfortable with both Ember and our codebase. Since we only support evergreen browsers, we can push the boundaries of what’s possible on the web platform while working with truly massive amounts of data. Our ideal candidates are sensitive to the needs of the users and love to find solutions in a unique and dynamic problem space.

We’re a highly collaborative and friendly group that prizes collaboration over competition. We provide opportunities to learn new skills, mentor fellow engineers, and contribute to the direction of both the team and the products for which we’re responsible. We work in a distributed, remote-first, high-trust environment where you manage your own time and have the flexibility to balance your work and personal life.















The Engineering Internship is fully remote and requires no travel. Your work location is the city/town/province you will be working from remotely. For our 12 - 16 week internship program (pending candidate availability), interns are allowed to work remotely from an alternative location for up to 2 weeks. Interns are also invited to work out of the CrowdStrike office located closest to their remote location.
