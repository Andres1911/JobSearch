We are seeking a software developer who is passionate about software development and technically excellent. Our developers work across the full stack of an application and understand that a project is not done until it has been deployed to production for our users. We want developers who can contribute positively to our culture and teach us things we didn't know before. Those same developers are always hungry to learn and improve in any way they can.

Our developers take a leadership role in stewarding the code to ever higher standards, mentoring other developers on the team and driving forward the technical direction of both Curve and its products.

We are looking to hire two new graduate software developers for a 12 month temporary position.





If you have less than two years of working experience please provide your GPA and a copy of your transcript. Please include any relevant additional information such as projects, co-ops and internships.

This role will require the individual to work in our Calgary lab as needed.

This is a one year contract position.
