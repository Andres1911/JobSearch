About the job
Introduction

At IBM, work is more than a job - it's a calling: To build. To design. To code. To consult. To think along with clients and sell. To make markets. To invent. To collaborate. Not just to do something better, but to attempt things you've never thought possible. Are you ready to lead in this new era of technology and solve some of the world's most challenging problems? If so, lets talk.



This position resides in Markham, ON and is a 12-month work term commencing in Sep 2025. It is mandatory that all applicants are enrolled in full-time studies at a post-secondary institution and returning to full-time studies upon completion of the work term.

The candidate will work alongside a team of full stack developers and Sales Enablement professionals building automation, productivity tools, as well as helping with content for multiple enablement programs. The successful candidate will be responsible for developing back-end applications using python and java which will interact with front end frameworks to improve the workflow of sales enablement professionals.

The candidate will also be unit testing multiple courses and demos and will learn about current technologies, working to integrate distinct education and enablement systems to ensure migration with these systems is a smooth process for end users.

The candidate will be a self-directed and self-motivated individual always looking for creative ways to solve problems and should possess strong planning, organizational, and organizational skills.
