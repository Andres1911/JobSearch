## Job Description

About the job
Who We Are; What We Do; Where We’re Going

Magnet Forensics is a global leader in the development of digital investigative software that acquires, analyzes, and shares evidence from computers, smartphones, tablets, and IoT-related devices. We are continually innovating so our customers can deploy advanced and effective tools to protect their companies, communities, and countries.

Serving thousands of customers globally, our solutions are playing a crucial role in modernizing digital investigations, helping investigators fight crime, protect assets, and guard national security.

With employees based around the world, Magnet Forensics has been expanding our global presence. As a part of Magnet Forensics, you can expect to make a difference in the world, no matter what role you play. You’ll be supported through learning and development, not to mention an incredible team with unbelievable talent and integrity.

If you think you would be the right person to join our team working towards this goal, we would love to hear from you!

Your Role

At Magnet Forensics, you will be fully integrated into our software development team. You'll start by getting comfortable with the code, working through bugs and basic features, all the while writing code that will actually be seen in production. As you ramp, you’ll be given more complex features just like any other member of the team. In fact, some of the key features of our software were written by our students!

What We Are Looking For

We hire passionate people who enjoy technical challenges. We love problem solvers who want to keep learning, individually and as part of the team. We want people who collaborate and help others. We foster a team environment where everyone is comfortable sharing their ideas, because we understand that with diversity of thought, we will build the best products.

We’re looking for someone who checks off most, but not all, of the boxes. It’s more important to us to find a candidate who can displaythrough skills they have developed and experience they have been a part of, than to find folks who have “been there, done that”. We want to be a part of your development journey, and we’ll learn as much from you as you learn from us.

There are a couple must haves, but we will keep that list short:



The Most Important Thing

We’re looking for candidates that can provide examples of how they have demonstrated Magnetin their previous experiences:

– We care about each other and our mission to make a difference in the world.

– We are accountable for our results – while never forgetting to act with integrity, empathy, and respect.

– We put our heart and soul into meeting the needs of our customers and helping them serve the people they protect.

– We are constantly innovating and exploring new ways to work together to make an impact with our work.
